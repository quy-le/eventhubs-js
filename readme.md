An Azure Event Hub client that is easy to use and performs well. From a local machine, I'm able to sustain **~300** messages per second from a single client. When running in an Azure VM in the same region as the Event Hubs instance, I was able to send **~400** messages per second. From a Raspberry PI, I was able to send **~40** messages per second.

### Simplest Usage

    eventHubs.init({
        hubNamespace: eventHubsNamespace,
        hubName: eventHubsHubName,
        keyName: eventHubsKeyName,
        key: eventHubsKey
    });

    var deviceMessage = {
        Temperature: 45.2,
        Pressure: 23.7
    }

    eventHubs.sendMessage({
        message: deviceMessage,
        deviceId: 1,
    });

**Note**: The `deviceId` property is optional now. If the deviceId property is present, eventHubs will construct the URI in the following format:

> https://{serviceNamespace}.servicebus.windows.net/{eventHubPath}/publishers/{deviceId}/messages

Otherwise, it uses the following format to construct the URI:

> https://{serviceNamespace}.servicebus.windows.net/{eventHubPath}/messages

Please see the [Azure Event Hub Documentation](https://{serviceNamespace}.servicebus.windows.net/{eventHubPath}/publishers/{deviceId}/messages) for more details
### Other Usages

When you initialize the event hubs client, it's advisable to use a SAS token in a production environment. This is a revokable key that is unique to the device. You can generate a token programatically, or [online using this form](http://eventhubssasgenerator.azurewebsites.net/).

    eventHubs.init({
        hubNamespace: eventHubsNamespace,
        hubName: eventHubsHubName,
        sasToken: sasToken
    });

### Installation

	npm install eventhubs-js

Don't forget to update your `package.json` file.

### Performance Optimizations

Performance was optimized in a number of ways:

1. Setting `http.globalAgent.maxSockets = 50;` increases the HTTP connection pool, which allows us to create more connections to serve messages that need sent. If you don't send a large volume of messages, no problem, the pool will remain relatively empty.
1. Caching the SAS Tokens. I haven't tested the performance of the node.js crypto libraries and moment time calculations, but it was easy enough to cache the generated SAS tokens to avoid recalcuating on each message.

### Examples & Promises

Promises allow you to chain calls without "callback hell":

    eventHubs.sendMessage({
        message: deviceMessage,
        deviceId: 1,
    }).then(function() {
		console.log('Message Sent!');
	});

Promises also allow us to kick of multiple send requests simultaneously, and easily manage the results:

	var promise, promises;
    
	for (i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
        promise = eventHubs.sendMessage({
        	message: deviceMessage,
			deviceId: 1,
    	});

        promises.push(promise);
    }
    Q.allSettled(promises).then(function () {
        console.log('All Messages Sent!');
    });
